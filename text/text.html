        <p class="intro">
            The <a class="breed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">Birard</a>, Partly as a consequence of the mechanisation of agriculture and 
            resulting rural depopulation of the post-War years, the Berger de Brie came to be commonly 
            kept as a companion dog. In the 1970s and 1980s, its numbers increased substantially.

                The Underneath the Briards long, shaggy coat lies a bold spirit and keen intelligence.

            True to their French roots, they can be aloof with strangers, but are affectionate and loving toward members of their pack.

            Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. 
            Remember to adopt! Dont shop if you want to bring a dog home.
            
            Bred as herding and guard dogs to protect flocks and fight off predators, 
            these canines were adopted as working dogs during World War I and used by troops as sentries, 
            ammunition carriers, messengers, and medic dogs. Today, the Briard enjoys the life of a companion dog, 
            but they show their versatility and working nature with their great successes in obedience, agility.
